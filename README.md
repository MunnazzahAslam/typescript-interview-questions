# 1. What is TypeScript, and why would I use it in place of JavaScript?

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static typing (type checking is done at compile time and you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them), classes and interfaces.
- It allows for better error-spotting in IDEs.
- It can lead to more robust software in large projects while still being deployable like regular JavaScript.
